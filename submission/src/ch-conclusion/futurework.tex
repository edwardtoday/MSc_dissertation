\section{Future Work}

As shown in Chapter ~\ref{ch:experiment}, the error rate in recognition using only the (Maximum Depth, Horizontal Cross-section Area, Radial Line Length are much higher than the cases when Mean Curvature Image is used. The problem with the latter one is its computation time.

There has not been a thorough analysis of possible features of the pure depth map. It remains unknown how much performance gain can be obtained by incorporating the 3D system.
