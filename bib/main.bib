abstract = {This paper presents a new stochastic marked point process for describing images in terms of a finite library of geometric objects. Image analysis based on conventional marked point processes has already produced convincing results but at the expense of parameter tuning, computing time, and model specificity. Our more general multimarked point process has simpler parametric setting, yields notably shorter computing times, and can be applied to a variety of applications. Both linear and areal primitives extracted from a library of geometric objects are matched to a given image using a probabilistic Gibbs model, and a Jump-Diffusion process is performed to search for the optimal object configuration. Experiments with remotely sensed images and natural textures show that the proposed approach has good potential. We conclude with a discussion about the insertion of more complex object interactions in the model by studying the compromise between model complexity and efficiency.},

abstract = {A framework for extracting salient local features from 3D models is presented in this study. In the proposed method, the amount of curvature at a surface point is specified by a positive quantitative measure known as the curvedness. This value is invariant to rigid body transformation such translation and rotation. The curvedness at a surface position is calculated at multiple scales by fitting a manifold to the local neighbourhoods of different sizes. Points corresponding to local maxima and minima of curvedness are selected as suitable features and a confidence measure of each keypoint is also calculated based on the deviation of its curvedness from the neighbouring values. The advantage of this framework is its applicability to both 3D meshes and unstructured point clouds. Experimental results on a different number of models are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.},

abstract = {Palmprint has proved to be one of the most unique and stable biometric characteristics. Almost all the current palmprint recognition techniques capture the 2-D image of the palm surface and use it for feature extraction and matching. Although 2-D palmprint recognition can achieve high accuracy, the 2-D palmprint images can be counterfeited easily and much 3-D depth information is lost in the imaging process. This paper explores a 3-D palmprint recognition approach by exploiting the 3-D structural information of the palm surface. The structured light imaging is used to acquire the 3-D palmprint data, from which several types of unique features, including mean curvature image, Gaussian curvature image, and surface type, are extracted. A fast feature matching and score-level fusion strategy are proposed for palmprint matching and classification. With the established 3-D palmprint database, a series of verification and identification experiments is conducted to evaluate the proposed method. The results demonstrate that 3-D palmprint technique has high recognition performance. Although its recognition rate is a little lower than 2-D palmprint recognition, 3-D palmprint recognition has higher anticounterfeiting capability and is more robust to illumination variations and serious scrabbling in the palm surface. Meanwhile, by fusing the 2-D and 3-D palmprint information, much higher recognition rate can be achieved.},

However, in prior work, the preprocessing of ear images has had manual steps and algorithms have not necessarily handled problems caused by hair and earrings. We present a complete system for ear biometrics, including automated segmentation of the ear in a profile view image and 3D shape matching for recognition. We evaluated this system with the largest experimental study to date in ear biometrics, achieving a rank-one recognition rate of 97.8 percent for an identification scenario and an equal error rate of 1.2 percent for a verification scenario on a database of 415 subjects and 1,386 total probes.},

abstract = {Recently with the development of 3D modeling and digitizing tools, more and more models have been created, which leads to the necessity of the technique of 3D model retrieval system. In this paper we investigate a new method for 3D model retrieval based on orthogonal projections. We assume that 3D models are composed of trigonal meshes. Algorithms proceed first by a normalization step in which the 3D models are transformed into canonical coordinates. Then each model is orthogonally projected onto six surfaces of the projected cube which contains it. A following step is feature extraction of the projected images which is done by moment invariants and polar radius Fourier transform. The feature vector of each 3D model is composed of the features extracted from projected images with different weights. Our system validates that this means can distinguish 3D models effectively. Experiments show that our method performs quit well.},
