In this paper, I will find features for authentication in the existing 3-D palmprint database. The features shall be stable in samples of a single person over time and distinguishable among samples of different people.

An identification process based on the features will be proposed.

The process will go through 8,000 samples in the database to be checked for stability and error rate.
