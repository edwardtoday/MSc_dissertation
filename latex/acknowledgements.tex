% I would like to thank the Math department for providing the original documentclass file that this class is based upon. I would like to thank my parents, without whom my life would not be possible. I would also like to thank my advisor, my dissertation committee, and my research collaborators because every graduate student needs to do so. And finally, I thank the members of my research group, to whom I leave this template to save you some of the trouble I had to go through getting my dissertation to compile in \LaTeX{}.

Firstly, I would like to thank my advisor, David Zhang, for leading me into biometrics research, for insightful remarks and useful advice during my MSc. study, and for his advice on how to conduct scientific research. It has been an privilege to work under his supervision.

I would also like to thank Professor Lei Zhang for what I have learned in the Multimedia Computing course. The experience not only leads to a more systematic knowledge of the area, but also urges me to practice everything with real data.

During my time working on this dissertation, Dr. Wei Li helped me a lot in the data processing part. I want to thank him for saving me a huge amount of time dealing with the dataset.
