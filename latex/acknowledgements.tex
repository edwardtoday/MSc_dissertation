Firstly, I would like to thank my advisor, David Zhang, for leading me into biometrics research, for insightful remarks and useful advice during my MSc. study, and for his advice on how to conduct scientific research. It has been an privilege to work under his supervision.

I would also like to thank Professor Lei Zhang for what I have learned in the Multimedia Computing course. The experience not only leads to a more systematic knowledge of the area, but also urges me to practice everything with real data.

During my time working on this dissertation, Dr. Wei Li helped me a lot in the data processing part. I want to thank him for saving me a huge amount of time dealing with the dataset.
