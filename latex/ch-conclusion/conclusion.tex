This paper proposed three global features for 3D palmprint images: Maximum Depth (MD), Horizontal Cross-section Area (HCA) and Radial Line Length (RLL). These cannot be extracted from 2D palmprints and are not correlated with local features, such as line and texture features. To make these global features efficient for use in coarse classification, we treat them as a multi-dimensional vector and use OLDA to map it to a lower dimensional space. We then improve the efficiency of 3D palmprint recognition using two proposed approaches, coarse-level matching and RSVM, both of which significantly reduce the penetration rate during retrieval. Our recognition experiments using an established 3D palmprint database of 8,000 samples show that the global features improve palmprint classification which greatly reduces search times.
