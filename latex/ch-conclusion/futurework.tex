\section{Future Work}

As shown in Chapter ~\ref{ch:experiment}, the error rate in recognition using only the (Maximum Depth, Horizontal Cross-section Area, Radial Line Length are much higher than the cases when Mean Curvature Image is used. The problem with the latter one is its computation time.

The most interesting direction for future work is to find more descriptive and efficient features for the 3D ROI.
