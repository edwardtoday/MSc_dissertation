\section{Feature Calculation}
\label{sec:methodology:featurecalc}

Using the ROI obtained from the original 3D palmprint data, we extract three kinds of features to describe the shape of the 3D palmprint: Maximum Depth (MD) of palm center, the Horizontal Cross-section Area (HCA) of different levels and the Radial Line Length (RLL) from the centroid to the boundary of 3D palmprint horizontal cross-section of different levels.
