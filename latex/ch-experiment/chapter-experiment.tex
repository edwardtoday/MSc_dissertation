We used the 3D palmprint acquisition device developed in [13] to establish a 3D palmprint database containing 8000 samples collected from 400 palms. The 3D palmprint samples were collected in two separated sessions, 10 samples in each session. The average time interval between the two sessions is one month. The collection procedure required volunteers to put their palms naturally and without force on the device. The original spatial resolution of the data was 768×576. After ROI extraction, the central part (400×400) was extracted and downsampled to (200×200) for feature extraction and recognition.
