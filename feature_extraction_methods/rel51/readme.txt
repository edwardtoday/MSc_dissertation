Filterbank-Based Fingerprint Matching (A.K.Jain, S.Prabhakar, L.Hong and S.Pankanti, 2000)

Abstract
With identity fraud in our society reaching unprecedented proportions and with an increasing emphasis on 
the emerging automatic personal identification applications, biometrics-based verification, especially 
fingerprint-based identification, is receiving a lot of attention. There are two major shortcomings
of the traditional approaches to fingerprint representation. For a considerable fraction of population, 
the representations based on explicit detection of complete ridge structures in the fingerprint are 
difficult to extract automatically. The widely used minutiae-based representation does not utilize a 
significant component of the rich discriminatory information available in the fingerprints. Local ridge 
structures cannot be completely characterized by minutiae. Further, minutiae-based matching has difficulty 
in quickly matching two fingerprint images containing different number of unregistered minutiae points. 
The proposed filter-based algorithm uses a bank of Gabor filters to capture both local and global details 
in a fingerprint as a compact fixed length FingerCode. The fingerprint matching is based on the Euclidean 
distance between the two corresponding FingerCodes and hence is extremely fast. We are able to achieve a 
verification accuracy which is only marginally inferior to the best results of minutiae-based algorithms 
published in the open literature. Our system performs better than a state-of-the-art minutiae-based system 
when the performance requirement of the application system does not demand a very low false acceptance rate. 
Finally, we show that the matching performance can be improved by combining the decisions of the matchers 
based on complementary (minutiae-based and filter-based) fingerprint information.
